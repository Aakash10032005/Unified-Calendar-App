Unified Calendar App


üåü Project Overview
The Unified Calendar App is a mobile application designed to simplify schedule management by integrating multiple external calendar services into a single, cohesive view. In today's busy world, individuals often juggle events across various platforms like Google Calendar, Outlook, and personal local calendars. This fragmentation leads to missed appointments, double-bookings, and a general lack of clarity regarding one's commitments.

Our solution provides a centralized Flutter-based mobile interface that aggregates all your events, allowing you to view, create, update, and delete events seamlessly across different connected services. This enhances productivity, reduces stress, and offers a holistic perspective on your personal and professional life.

‚ú® Features
Centralized Event View: See all your events from connected external calendars and local app events in one intuitive interface.

Google Calendar Integration: Securely connect your Google Calendar account via OAuth2 for seamless event synchronization.

Event Management (CRUD):

Create Events: Add new events to any connected external calendar or to a dedicated "custom" calendar within the app.

View Event Details: Access comprehensive information for each event, including description, location, and attendees.

Update Events: Modify existing events, with changes synchronizing back to the original external service.

Delete Events: Remove events, which also propagates the deletion to the external calendar if applicable.

Attendee Status Management: Respond to event invitations (accept/decline) directly from the app.

Real-time Syncing: Events are periodically synchronized with external services to keep your calendar up-to-date.

User Authentication: Secure user registration and login with JWT-based authentication.

Responsive UI: A modern, user-friendly mobile interface built with Flutter.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the Unified Calendar project locally.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js)

MongoDB Atlas Account (or a local MongoDB instance)

Google Cloud Project (with Google Calendar API enabled and OAuth Consent Screen configured)

Flutter SDK (latest stable version recommended)

A code editor like VS Code

Postman or Insomnia for API testing

1. Backend Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/unified_calendar_backend.git
cd unified_calendar_backend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Create a .env file:
In the root of your unified_calendar_backend directory, create a file named .env and add the following environment variables:

PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.f23yxan.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
JWT_SECRET=your_very_long_and_complex_secret_key_for_jwt_do_not_share_this_in_public_repos
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/calendars/google/callback

Replace <username> and <password> with your MongoDB Atlas database user credentials.

JWT_SECRET should be a long, random string.

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, and GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI are obtained from your Google Cloud Project. Ensure http://localhost:3000/api/calendars/google/callback is listed as an authorized redirect URI in your Google Cloud OAuth 2.0 Client ID settings.

Start the backend server:

npm run dev

The server should start on http://localhost:3000. Confirm by visiting http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

2. Frontend (Flutter) Setup
Navigate to the Flutter project directory:

cd ../unified_calendar_app # Assuming it's in a sibling directory

Install Flutter dependencies:

flutter pub get

Configure Backend URL in Flutter:
Open lib/providers/auth_provider.dart and update the _baseUrl variable:

// For Android Emulator, use 10.0.2.2 instead of localhost
// For web/desktop, 'localhost' is fine
final String _baseUrl = "http://10.0.2.2:3000/api"; // Or "http://localhost:3000/api" for web/desktop

Save the file.

Run the Flutter application:

flutter run

Choose your preferred device (emulator, physical device, or web browser).
